## Description

This is a test task for vacancy of Unity developer.
Game should represents an parametric cube spawner. 

I have found two ways to acheive task metrics for cube spawners.
First one is brute object manager that instantiates cubes from prefabs and directs them to target position where they are destroys themselves.
Second one is to use built-in particle system which is more flexible and elegant way. 
Built-in UI event system were used to control spawners.
